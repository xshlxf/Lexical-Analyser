This project explores the validation of strings against Context-Free Grammars (CFG) using Python. It also evaluates examples generated by AI to analyze their compliance with defined grammars.

Features

Grammar Validators:
Palindromes.
Strings with equal counts of 'a' and 'b'.
Balanced parentheses.
Grammar a^n,b^n,c^n.

AI Integration:
Testing grammar rules on AI-suggested examples.
Evaluation of AI performance in generating valid strings.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Recommended: Virtual environment for dependencies (if applicable).
